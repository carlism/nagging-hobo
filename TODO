- Formalize configuration: get the hostnames and paths out of the app.rb file.
- Restructure a bit: extract the datamapper stuff to a seperate file at a minimum.
- Responses: nothing valuable is returned from my calls, should return something useful.
- Testing?!: Possibly test around some of the formatting bits and test the helper functions
- Client!:  Need to write the command-line client
- Maintenence: Should have a means for deleting a scheduled message.
- Some error handling couldn't hurt either.
